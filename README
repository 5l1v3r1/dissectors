Snort has limited actions same as ( alert, log, drop, etc..) but it doesn't has REDIRECT action,
this tool can redirect the suspicious connections if they were matched with snort rules which have 'alert' as an action. this will be done by making the user specify a priority number, so if snort alerted the specified priority number or any higher severity priority number ( smaller priority number has higher severity ) then the whole traffic of the suspicious ip will be redirected to a honeypot machine and for this the tool need iptables to be configured. Remember this tool will consider only snort rules with 'alert' as an action. this tool also offer a monitoring console for the redirected connections this has been done by implementing tcpdump sniffer. All this with friendly graphical user interface.
